# Password Strength Evaluation 

## Objective
The goal of this task is to understand how password complexity impacts security by creating and evaluating passwords of varying strength levels (Weak, Medium, Strong).

##  Tool Used
- [PasswordMonster](https://www.passwordmonster.com/) – Free online password strength checker
- Microsoft Excel – to document password samples and their strength
- Python – to generate a random set of 100 passwords

##  Deliverables
- 100 randomly generated passwords
- Passwords labeled as **Weak**, **Medium**, or **Strong**
- Password Strength Report: [Password_Strength_Report.docx](Password_Strength_Report.docx)

##  Key Concepts Covered
- **Password Strength Evaluation**
- **Best Practices for Strong Passwords**
- **Common Password Attacks**
  - Brute-force attack
  - Dictionary attack
- **Password Creation Techniques**
  - Use of uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols
  - Use of long and unpredictable combinations

## What I Learned
- Passwords with predictable patterns (e.g., `123456`, `nithya123`) are weak and easily cracked.
- Adding symbols, numbers, and mixed-case letters increases password strength.
- Strong passwords should be at least 12 characters long with complexity.
- PasswordMonster helped understand how long different passwords would take to crack.
- Password managers and multi-factor authentication greatly enhance security.

##  Conclusion
Through this task, I gained valuable insights into what makes a password strong and how attackers exploit weak credentials using methods like brute-force and dictionary attacks. By generating and testing 100 passwords using [PasswordMonster](https://www.passwordmonster.com/), I observed how different combinations of characters significantly impact the time required to crack them.

This hands-on experience emphasized the importance of:
- Using longer, complex, and unique passwords.
- Avoiding common patterns or reused credentials.
- Adopting password managers and enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) for better protection.

Ultimately, strong passwords are a **critical first line of defense** in cybersecurity, and understanding their construction is essential for both users and professionals in the field.
